# DSCILib: A lightweight data science library
A lightweight data science library, made for the MCM and HiMCM competitions for new programmers.
Simple, made to be adaptable to all kinds of situations.

**Currently a work in progress**

## Features

#### Variety of blackbox optimization algorithms
Regardless of what kind of predictive algorithms you're using, all the optimization algorithms are *blackbox* algorithms - few assumptions are made, allowing these optimization algorithms to adapt to different situations: these include (currently)
- Coordinate descent

---

#### Data Processing
Includes functions to read data from a csv in string/double format, and rotation/inversion of 2D matrices.
